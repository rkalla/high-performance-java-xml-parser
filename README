Description
-----------
Project goal is to create the world's fastest XML parser by making the following
design decisions up-front:

	* Non-validating, no logic inside the parser to honor a DTD or Schema
	* Non-well-formedness, parser looks for tag boundaries only.
	* No byte-to-char decoding until the value is retrieved

All parsing is done directly on the raw bytes, marking off tag boundaries and
firing back XML Pull-esque-events to the caller when found. Only when the
values from the XML are retrieved is anything parsed out of the data stream.
